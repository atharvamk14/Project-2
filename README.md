The output is a table that shows the sentiment analysis results of tweets obtained from a Twitter search query. The table has two columns: "Tweet" and "Sentiment". Each row corresponds to a tweet, and the sentiment analysis result for that tweet is displayed in the "Sentiment" column. The sentiment of each tweet is classified into one of the following labels: "anger", "optimism", "joy", or blank (if the sentiment could not be determined).
The first row shows a tweet with an angry sentiment that mentions a user's query and a referral code. The second row shows a tweet with an optimistic sentiment that promotes obtaining an electronic certificate of origin. The third row shows a tweet with an angry sentiment that responds to a Chat GPT query about the dangers of AI. The fourth row shows a tweet with an angry sentiment that asks a user to contact via DM with a referral code and query. The fifth row shows a tweet with a joyful sentiment that mentions an attempted call. The sixth row shows a tweet with an angry sentiment that responds to a user query. The seventh and eighth rows show tweets with an angry sentiment that mention the "REVV Racing" and "British relations with Europe" respectively. The ninth and tenth rows show tweets with a joyful sentiment that mention a trade union in 1970 and the common market respectively. The eleventh row shows a tweet with an angry sentiment that responds to a query about a baby case with German authorities. The twelfth row shows a tweet with an optimistic sentiment that includes hashtags "SinfulSunday" and "eroticromance".


The code prompts the user to enter a valid Twitter handle (without the @ symbol), and then searches for tweets from that handle using the Twitter API. It then uses a pre-trained sentiment analysis pipeline from the Hugging Face Transformers library to analyze the sentiment of each tweet, and creates a table displaying the results.
1. What do I send?
The user sends a valid Twitter handle (without the @ symbol) as input to the program.
2. What do I get?
The program retrieves tweets from the specified Twitter handle using the Twitter API, and performs sentiment analysis on each tweet using a pre-trained model. It outputs a table displaying the text of each tweet along with its predicted sentiment.
3. What is the format of the data?
The data retrieved from the Twitter API is in JSON format, and contains various fields such as the text of the tweet, the date it was posted, and metadata about the user who posted it. The output table has two columns: the text of each tweet, and its predicted sentiment (which is a string indicating one of several possible emotions).
4. How can I use such data?
The retrieved data and sentiment analysis results can be used in various ways, such as monitoring public opinion on a particular topic or brand, understanding sentiment trends over time, or identifying potential areas for improvement in marketing or customer service. The data can also be used for further analysis, such as natural language processing or machine learning tasks.
